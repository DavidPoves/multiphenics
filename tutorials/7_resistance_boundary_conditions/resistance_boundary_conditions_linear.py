In this tutorial we solve the problem

       - \Delta u = f                       in \Omega
                u = u_ex                    on \Gamma_1
     \partial_n u = \int_{\Gamma_2} u ds    on \Gamma_2
                u = u_ex                    on \Gamma_3
                u = u_ex                    on \Gamma_4
                
which is, in weak form

      \int_{\Omega} \nabla u \cdot \nabla v dx - (\int_{\Gamma_2} u ds) * (\int_{\Gamma_2} v ds) = 0
             
where
    \Omega                    unit square
    u \in H^1(\Omega)         unknown
    u_ex = x - 1              exact solution
